# shortener-webapp
This is a quick project using Angular with [nebular UI Library](https://github.com/akveo/nebular) and spring-boot

## Running the project in a development server
In order to run the project you have to follow these simple steps.

### frontend
first go to the Angular root folder, install the dependencies running the npm install command

    npm install

then start the development server at `localhost:4200`. using this command on the terminal

    ng serve

### backend
Import the project as a Maven project/spring-boot project to your IDE and just start the spring-boot application using your IDE and it should be all set-up.

The backend was done only using the idea IDE, and if you have it should be easier to set up everything. But I guess that you can just open in another IDE and just run the spring-boot application normally.

### production server

The project was not yet set up to a production enviroment.
